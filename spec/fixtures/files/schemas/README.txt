.gitignore file.

Then, copy the following files and folders to the given locations:
 *  https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-message-api-docs/tree/master/messages  => willow/willow/spec/fixtures/files/schemas/jisc_rdss/messages
 *  https://github.com/JiscRDSS/rdss-message-api-docs/tree/master/schemas   => willow/willow/spec/fixtures/files/schemas/jisc_rdss/schemas
